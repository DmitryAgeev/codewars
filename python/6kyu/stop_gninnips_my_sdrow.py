Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string,
but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata).

spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw"
spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test"
spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
